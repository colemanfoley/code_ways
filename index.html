			So you want to make web apps? You should start with the front end. You will definitely need to be able to make front ends. You can make simple interactive pages knowing only front-end development. You can even hook your front end up to a pre-made back end, or <b>Back end as a Service</b>, lessening the need to build a back end for your first few little projects.
			<section id="frontend">
				<h2>Front End</h2>
				<p>
				Well, you need to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for sure.
				If you're going to make stuff on the web, you're definitely going to use those. These technologies 
				are how people create the front ends of web applications. HTML and CSS are good ones to start with because they are
				easier than JavaScript or any of the other programming languages you will use on the back end of your app.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="backend">
				<h2>Back End</h2>
				<p>
				It's when you get to the back end that things get interesting. There are tons of choices. Some popular
				languages right now are Python and Ruby. You can even use JavaScript, which is nice, because it means you don't have to learn another language to make a back end. So, which do you want to use?
				</p>
				<div id="backendButtonGroup" class="btn-group" data-toggle="buttons-radio">
					<button class="btn btn-primary" id="javascript">JavaScript</button>
					<button class="btn btn-primary" id="python">Python</button>
					<button class="btn btn-primary" id="ruby">Ruby</button>
